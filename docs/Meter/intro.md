# Introduction

When receiving an airdrop for a certain token, or interacting with the contracts that they want to invest in, users may want to verify a token’s authenticity, check the security of a contract to be interacted with or get relevant information such as potential risks of a specific address to perform due diligence. This smart contract risk query API is developed to mainly serve these needs.

This service can be integrated into other products of the company such as Trust Wallet etc, developers need to choose a suitable API interface to perform integration. This API service mainly takes on-chain addresses as input, along with different configurations that cater to developers’ needs. After each query, the information and results will be stored into the analysis system and help generate further information in the future.
