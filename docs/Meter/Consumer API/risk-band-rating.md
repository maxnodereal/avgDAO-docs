# Risk Band Rating Description

We have created band ratings to provide a reference risk level for contracts on the BNB Chain. The band ratings range from Very High Risk to Very Low Risk. In determining the band rating, we have taken into account a variety of factors including, not limited to, whether the contract contains known vulnerabilities or malicious code, implements industry recommendations, and permissions and code audit considerations. Interacting with contracts with lower band ratings may have a higher risk of loss of funds. Users are recommended to always DYOR before interacting with any contract.

* Risk Band 1 - Very High Risk
* Risk Band 2 - High Risk
* Risk Band 3 - Medium Risk
* Risk Band 4 - Low Risk
* Risk Band 5 - Very Low Risk
