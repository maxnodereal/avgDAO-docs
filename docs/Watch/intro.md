# Introduction

In the blockchain world, there are new transactions every moment, and new blocks are generated every moment. Users want to receive notifications as soon as some events happen to help them make the best decisions in order to avoid risks or obtain benefits. Watch-Bus can help users quickly realize such demands.

Watch-Bus can be integrated into other products of the company, such as Wallet, Dapp Store, Dex, etc. The API service mainly takes the address on the chain and the type of [event](https://www.avengerdao.org/docs/watch/detail-spec/Specification) that the user wants to monitor as input. After the subscription is successful, Watch-Bus will continue to monitor the event on the chain, and when the conditions are met, the information will be notified to the subscriber as soon as possible.
