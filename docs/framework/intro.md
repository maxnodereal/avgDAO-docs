# Securing the Future of Decentralized Finance: The Need for a Comprehensive Web3 Security Framework

## Introduction

In 2022, the world of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi) reached a concerning milestone with $3.8 billion in stolen funds, of which $3.1 billion originated from the DeFi sector[1]. This alarming figure is equivalent to the total amount of funds hacked in the previous year, emphasizing the growing security challenges in the swiftly evolving digital landscape. Cryptocurrencies now play a crucial geostrategic and geopolitical role, as demonstrated by events such as the Lazarus Group's hack on Axie Infinity, international banking sanctions, and the emergence of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) amidst a global de-dollarization trend.
Given these developments, the potential role of crypto asset-based financial services in the future cannot be ignored. And we must assume the responsibility of building a secure ecosystem for future financial and monetary services and systems that interact with DeFi.

## Tooling and Best Practices.

This cannot only be accomplished through the appropriate combination of tools, such as risk assessment, monitoring and alerting, incident response, and hack prevention measures. We must increase the overall security of the ecosystem by advocating for the creation and adoption of web3 security best practices, similar to ISO Standard, whose goal is to improve product and service quality, and enhance consumer safety and confidence.

## The Importance of Collaboration and Standardization

Developing a comprehensive Web3 security framework requires collaboration and coordination among various stakeholders, including cybersecurity experts, Web3 projects, developers and regulators. By working together, we can identify emerging threats, share knowledge, and develop standardized best practices that can be applied across the Web3 ecosystem. This collaboration is vital to ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of DeFi and other decentralized technologies.

We extend our **gratitude** to the AvengerDAO members who recognized the importance of collaborating on the topic and made valuable contributions to the development of the document:

## That sounds interesting but what is the Web3 Security Framework concretely?

Similar to ISO standards, our Web3 Security Framework aims to establish best practices for Web3 projects, taking into account not only technical aspects such as smart contracts, Solidity programming language, smart contract architecture risks, decentralized applications, and Decentralized Finance-related risks, but also addressing managerial elements like project processes, development lifecycle, crypto wallet management and incorporating DevSecOps processes. Additionally, we will focus on business continuity and treasury management. Our objective is to create a comprehensive set of guidelines for safeguarding various components of a crypto project and ultimately securing project and users crypto assets.

To achieve this goal, we propose a list of security frameworks that address the complex and distinct aspects involved in managing a crypto project, fostering a more secure environment for all participants.

It is important to note that our aim is not to overlap with other cybersecurity initiatives, such as OWASP, but rather to reference and complement them by focusing specifically on the unique challenges facing Web3 projects.

In addition to securing project and community funds, as well as enhancing trust, these standards will enable Web3 projects to pursue a web3 security certification through AvengerDAO.
